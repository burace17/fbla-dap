By: Blair Urish and Trevor Rosine
———————————

This software allows you to register for NFLC, register for NFLC workshops, and view various reports.

Requirements:
Windows XP or later
90 MB of disk space


Instructions for running:
Open the file named “NFLC Registration”
The software will then run.


Usage Instructions:
As soon as the application opens, you will be greeted by the home screen. From there you may choose a task. The NFLC registration and workshop registration tasks are very similar, all you have to do is input your information and hit submit. You can even enter multiple records one after the other if you?d like. As for the reports, you may hit the button for the reports task and you will be taken to the reporting area. A list of reports will be on the side bar and clicking on one of them will show the results. Each report has a different set of filtering options. 

If you’d like to return to the home screen from any page, simply click on the “National Fall Leadership Conference” link in the header.


Program Architecture:
To start the program, I created a simple C program that uses the win32 API. I use this because nw.exe requires some command line arguments

Our program utilizes a framework called Node-Webkit. This combines two frameworks: Node.js and WebKit. Node.js allows developers to run server-side code in JavaScript and WebKit is the rendering engine that powers Google Chrome. Together, they allow developers to create desktop applications using the latest web technology.

For our purposes, this was extremely useful. Web technologies when applied on the desktop create very intuitive user experiences. 

Our program?s user interface was created using Twitter’s Bootstrap framework. It allows developers who are not talented graphic designers (like ourselves) to create interfaces that are appealing to the end user.

One major JavaScript library was used, and it was jQuery. jQuery is used on nearly every major web site. It proved very useful with our desktop application, allowing us to write code quickly and focus more on the user experience.
